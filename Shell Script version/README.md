Strapper - Bash version
========

Two scripts here
the first one, strapper, just gets ad site information.
the second one makes soap calls based on a siteid that it gets from the first script.
These scripts function on their own. And they were combined into the pashua version with a few extra tweaks.
These are basically just proof of concept scripts.
There was no need to make this a fully functioning version of the pashua script as the end result was always the GUI version
