Strapper
========

This version uses Pashua and Cocoa dialog to provide some nice GUI objects for the user to interact with.

Strapper is a quick application/script written to provide some basic AD authentication and authorization before running deploystudio.

Version 2.0 adds in extra functionality to make SOAP requests based on user input to determine building level and room numbers
This information is then saved to the local machine and is put into the ARD text fields. this location data is also uploaded to the computers AD record.
These actions are carried out by a script run at first boot after imaging and AD bind functions.
